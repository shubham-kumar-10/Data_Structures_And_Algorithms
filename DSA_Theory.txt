Data Structures are a way of organize , store and manage data efficiently.  

Some of the common data strutures are as follows:
1) Array – Good for accessing data in O(1).
2) Linked List – Efficient inserts/deletes (O(1) at head), slower random access.
3) HashMap / Dictionary – Fast key-based lookups (O(1) average).
4) Set/HashSet - Good for checking duplicates in O(1). 
5) Stack - Follows LIFO (Last In First Out)
6) Queue - Follows FIFO (First In First Out)
7) Heap - This data structrue is helpful to find the maximum or minimum element quickly.
